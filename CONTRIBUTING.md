Thank you for your interest in contributing! Pull requests, bug fixes, and improvements are very welcome.


## Maintainer availability

This project is maintained by a single person in their spare time. Please be patient with response times; while I try to be responsive, things can occasionally slip through. Friendly reminders are appreciated.


## Code of conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions. We are all humans contributing in our free time, kindness makes collaboration easier and more enriching.


## Workflow

To avoid wasted effort, please follow this process before writing code:
- **Features**: Start a [Discussion](https://github.com/itskovacs/trip/discussions) first. This ensures we align on scope and design before you invest time.
- **Bugs**: Open an [Issue](https://github.com/itskovacs/trip/issues).
- **Implementation**: When opening an issue or discussion, fill the *Could you implement/fix it* dropdown.
- **Picking up tasks**: If you want to work on an existing item, comment on the thread to let me know you could work on it and briefly explain how you could implement it.


## Pull requests

- Keep PRs focused and atomic (one feature/fix per PR).
- Link the related Discussion or Issue in the description.
- Include context on *what* changed and *why*.
- **UI Changes**: Please include screenshots or a recording.
